        // So we are within the correct DocumentConfig and the path over the EmployeeDetailView should give the information about which employee we selected.
        // The selected Employee needs to be linked to an EmployeeConfig within the DocumentConfig.

        // selection-methods
        //  buttons: cancel, confirm
        // (optional) buttons: clear/unfill, default/fill, redo (restore), undo (discard)
